ANN consists of three layers; input layer, hidden layers (more than one) and output layer. ANN starts with input layer which includes the training data (with features), passes the data to the first hidden layer where the data is computed by the first hidden layer's weights. In hidden layers, there is an iteration of calculation of weights to the inputs and then apply them an activation function \\[2\\]. As our problem is regression, our last layer is a single output neuron: its output is the predicted the distances between pairs of fingerprint scans.
